#EXPLANATION::

-To Create The Database on your own machines, (using postgres) please copy the commands in application_setup,
-(although you gonna change the password and name to whatever yours is)
-from there run the following commands in the file to build out some test data

-As you work on the front end, ive provided the connectors to connect from front to backend, and some examples
of their use in the file connectors.ipynb, this is just the database side tho, copy what i have but for them to work,
more front end logic will be required.

-When the functions to import the main bulk of the data is built, please feel free to also use
the connectors ive provided to add, media, account, reviews

-When that data is built into the database, I can then start on the reccomendations portions
